# Tier Community Edition

This repository (`tier-discord-bot`) is where I develop the [discord](https://discord.com/) bot with the community.  
This source code is available to everyone under the standard [MIT license](LICENSE.md).

## Building Tier Community Edition
Tier requires [Node](https://nodejs.org/) v.16.6.0 or higher because using of [discord.js v13](https://discord.js.org/).  

If your system meets the requirement above then you're good to go!
You only need to run `yarn install` in your terminal and then start in your node environment.  

I suggest you to run Tier community edition in [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/), it is a daemon process manager that will help you manage and keep Tier online.
